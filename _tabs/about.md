<h4>Who are you?</h4>
<p>Hi, there! Apologies for this janky personal site.</p>

<h4>Who are you?</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Yagam11. I'm a student and a developer. I'm interested in programming, web development, and game development. (copilot generated)</p>

<h4>Who are you?</h4>
<p>Hi, I am Tianchi Huang, and I am from Shanghai, China. You can call me John as well. I am currently a junior @Boston University concentrating in Math and Computer Science. I am passionate about anime, music, game and basketball. My favorite anime is among DeathNote, Naruto, and Samurai Champloo. Also, my favorite starbucks drink is Mango Dragonfruit Refresher, less ice and without lemonade.</p>

<h4>What do you do?</h4>
<p>In addition to studies, I am part of the Hack4impact club where we code together and built a few projects; I am also very honored to work with Chonghua and Professor Kolachalama in the vkola lab. I learnt a lot about django web development working with Chonghua on the adrd tool project for AI assisted diagnosis.</p>

<h4>What do you wanna do later?</h4>
<p>Be honest it's frustrating and I am still very confused about future. Looking ahead, I am planning to take a master program after I graduate to prepare myself more before getting into the industry. Not clear whether due to pandemic or naiveness, my college time seems ephemeral looking back from junior summer. Likely gonna work a lot harder than I used to do.</p>
